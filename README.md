# `theos/vendor/include`
Headers included with Theos for easy compilation of most projects out of the box.

## Contributions are welcome!
Please send us headers you’ve put together that would be useful to the wider community. Be aware that we are looking for “clean” headers, *not* generated output from class-dump or a similar tool.

## Code rules
* Create headers only for what you use.
* Follow the existing coding style.
    * Objective-C properties should be in the style of `@property (attributes) type name;`
    * Objective-C methods should be in the style of `- (type)methodName:(type)variableName parameter:(type)name;`
    * Objective-C generics should be in the style of `NSDictionary <NSString *, NSArray <NSObject *> *> *variable`
* C functions and variables (all symbols) should be declared using `FOUNDATION_EXPORT`

    ```c
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

    FOUNDATION_EXPORT int ExternalVariable;
    FOUNDATION_EXPORT const int ExternalConstant;
    FOUNDATION_EXPORT void ExternalFunction(int param);
    ```
* Initialisers and singleton (e.g. `sharedInstance`) methods should return `instancetype`.
* Don't just copy and paste lines from class-dumps - replace `id` with the appropriate class. Also change `arg1` and the like, or in some cases class-dump-z’s guessed argument names, to something more appropriate. If you don’t know the type, Cycript or FLEX can be helpful:

    ```console
    $ cycript -p SpringBoard
    cy# [SBBaconController sharedInstance].baconCurrentlyBeingEaten.class
    @"SBBacon"
    ```

    Additionally, ensure the appropriate types are used. The most common ones are:

    * `float` and `double` should usually become `CGFloat` or `NSTimeInterval`
    * `int` and `long` should usually become `NSInteger`
    * `unsigned int` and `unsigned long` should usually become `NSUInteger`

    This is especially important when using the headers as reference for hooking. An incorrect Objective-C type encoding can cause problems.
* Import all relevant public SDK headers for types used in the header. This usually means using `#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>` or `#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>`. For private types, prefer to use `@class` and `@protocol`. If not possible, for instance for subclassing and protocol conformance, import the private header defining the type.
* For compatibility, prefer classic imports for modules:

    ```objc
    // Do:
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    #import <objc/runtime.h>

    // Don’t:
    @import Foundation;
    @import ObjectiveC.runtime;
    ```

    If modules are supported by the compiler, `#import` of headers from a module will be translated to equivalent `@import` statements.
* Any headers under an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) can be included here. Please add its license to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
  * That being said, please try to avoid including headers that are vended by their respective authors in separate, cross-platform "dev" packages (e.g., `openssl`, `libarchive`, etc)
